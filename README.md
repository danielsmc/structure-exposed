HyperDev is a developer playground that lets you code a real web-app without the slow setup and deployment steps. 


Your Project
------------

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env`

On the front-end,
- edit `client.js`, `style.css` and `index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
